# ContactManagement
Contact Management uses WEB API and EntityFramework.
For Dependency Injection I have used Unity Framework.
DAL layer is in separate project , DAL context is mocked for unit testing
All API responses are HttpResponseMessage which contains status code and data
For Unit testing MSTest and NSubstitute is used.
